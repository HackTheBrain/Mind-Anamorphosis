Hack The Brain Dublin 2017 Project

Virtual reality (VR) art allows a participant to experience disembodied presence in an immaterial, abstract space and when coupled with Brain Computer Interface it has the potential to allow a person to affect their virtual surrounding using their thoughts. We envisage the participant floating inside an immersive dreamscape VR environment, where the content of the virtual environment, visual, aural and motion can be controlled by, and responds to, the persons imagined movement. The focus will be on utilizing two waves in the alpha and beta range in primary sensorimotor cortex indicating motor intention or motor imagery of different body parts. The Mu rhythm which in the alpha range 7.5 to 12.5 Hz and the sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) in the range of 13 to 15 Hz both of which are dominant during rest but desynchronized when an individual is planning, executing, and imagining body movements. The inspiration for this work lies with the surrealists movement's idea of “automatic drawing” to adequately represent the unconscious mind and allow participants to step into their own painting where they might be more inclined to explore the potential personal meaning of what they find there as it responds to their thoughts – a mind Anamorphosis
